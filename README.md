# ACOMP
ACOMP sound compressor DOS port

This is working MS-DOS port of ACOMP assembly language compressor, written by John W. Ratcliff in 1991.
Changes:
Uncompressor modified to fix counter decrement overflow.
Wrapped in DOS functions, compressor parameters could be set via command-line.
Compressor is very processor-intensive.
